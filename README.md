# Pancake
Pancake is a visual project management and planning tool for software development teams that combines a Scrum task board with easy-to-use diagramming tools. Developers can collaborate in real-time to create wireframe UI mockups and entity-relationship diagrams to plan their app, and then associate user stories from their Scrum board with different elements of those diagrams to build a visualization of their projectâ€™s tasks. Pancake also integrates with GitHub, allowing instant synchronization of issues, labels, and pull requests to and from their repositories

Built as a group capstone project at Fullstack Academy.
